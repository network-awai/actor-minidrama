  "Plan-production entrypoint — run ONE episode theme through the actor
  (DramaLLM proposal → DramaGovernor → commit | hold) and, on :commit, emit
  the committed plan EDN to `.minidrama/episodes/<episode-id>.edn` — the work
  order the dougaka engine consumes (`dougaka.pipeline`, ADR-2607071500).
  scripts/produce-episode.bb chains produce → engine → announce.

  Governor doctrine is unchanged: a HOLD prints the violation basis and exits
  1 — no plan file is written for a rejected episode.

  Usage: clojure -M:dev -m minidrama.produce <theme> [episode-id] [duration]
