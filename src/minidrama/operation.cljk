  "OperationActor — one episode plan = one supervised actor run, expressed as
  a langgraph-clj StateGraph. The DramaLLM (contained intelligence node) is
  sealed into :advise; its proposal is ALWAYS routed through the DramaGovernor
  (:govern) before anything commits to the SSoT or announces on app-aozora.
  Mirrors the containment + independent-governor + append-only-ledger topology
  (tashikame.operation / tsumugu.operation / sng.synthesis).

  Everything the actor depends on is injected (each a swap, not a rewrite):
    - the Store     (MemStore | DatomicStore | kotoba-server)  — `store` arg
    - the Advisor   (mock DramaLLM | real-LLM on Murakumo)     — :advisor opt
    - the Publisher (Mock | real app-aozora createRecord)      — :publisher opt
    - the Phase     (0 draft → 1 unlisted → 2 public+approval) — :phase in ctx

  One run = intake → advise → govern → decide → commit | hold. NO unbounded
  inner loop. Unlike the fully-autonomous publishers, PUBLIC announcement
  (phase 2) additionally requires the explicit :publish approval in the run
  context (ADR-2607071300 gate ④) — the phase gate withholds announcement,
  and a DramaGovernor HARD violation withholds even the commit. Generation /
  assembly of actual video is NOT in this graph: the committed plan is the
  work order for the genapp-clj video engine (dougaka engine, follow-up)."
