  "DramaGovernor — the independent censor that earns a DramaLLM proposal the
  right to be committed (and, phase permitting, announced). SEPARATE system
  from the DramaLLM (defense in depth: never trust the generator to have been
  the only gate). Mirrors tashikame.governor's shape (HARD → HOLD, no
  override; SOFT → recorded warning, still commits).
